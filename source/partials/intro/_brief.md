Background
-----------------------------------

The [Energy Savings Scheme](http://www.ess.nsw.gov.au/Home) (ESS) subsidises improvements in energy efficiency and penalises carbon emitters through the trade of Energy Savings Certificates (ESC). These certificates are created by Accredited Certificate Providers (ACPs) who calculate the efficiencies gained by a client business. These certificates must then be bought by organisations deemed to be carbon emitters on an open market. One certificate is equivalent to one notional Megawatt hour of energy.

To create a certificate, ACPs must follow [guidelines](http://www.ess.nsw.gov.au/Audits_and_Compliance/Audit_and_compliance_guides) relating to how energy consumption is measured and approved products among others. They must also collect evidence to validate their assessment. These must be kept for seven years. ACPs are audited by NSW government [approved auditors](http://www.ess.nsw.gov.au/Audits_and_Compliance/List_of_Auditors) to ensure that the system is not rorted.

A typical way for businesses to improve their energy efficiency is to replace their lights with LED lights. An ACP will make a before and after visit to the site to record and gather evidence like:

* lumen output 
* required lumens for the workspace
* floor plans
* hours of use
* photo evidence etc. 

Currently, this is paper-based with entry to spreadsheet performed later. ACPs often market the upgrade proposals to businesses and handle subcontracting of electricians as well. 

The Brief
---------

The brief is to streamline the assessment process through the use of web technologies. Requirements include:

* smart phone compatible tool for on-site assessment
* offline capabilities to handle loss of network (to handle underground car parks etc)
* admin dashboard to verify assessment and perform administrative duties
* notification to assessor of assessment errors
* secure and robust data storage
* pdf or online dashboard for auditors
* pdf proposal to client
