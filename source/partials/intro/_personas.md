Personas/Roles
--------

#### Assessor ####

John is the lead electrician contracted to replace some industrial lights. He works with 5 other electricians. The ACP has trained John to perform the assessment task. Because John has to go onsite anyway, there is no need to send an assessor to the client's factory. John has a financial incentive to get the assessment done correctly and quickly.

#### Client ####

Even though he does not understand the ESS, Mario has accepted the proposal to change all the lights in his factory because the financial savings are obvious from the efficiency proposal. The upfront costs, quick ROI and long term savings make clear what can be gained. He is also impressed by the brighter and more even light from the sample LED.

#### Assessment Verification ####

Until now, George has been responsible for ensuring that the paperwork for certificate documentation is present and correctly filed. He has entered data into spreadsheets and sorted files. His primary concern is that all the necessary documentation and evidence is filed away until the auditor asks to see it. With a web application, he only needs to verify certain kinds of evidence, like photos and scanned documents, and view the assessment summary.

#### Web Admin ####

George also keeps the database up to date with changes in assessor details, login authorisation and the approved product lists.

#### Business Admin ####

Frank runs the ACP business and takes care of sales. He drafts the proposals based on the pre-work assessment. This involves calculating equipment and labour costs, energy savings for the client and profits from selling the certificates.

#### Auditor ####

Maxine knows the rules concerning the ESS better than anyone else. She is meticulous and thorough, but pressed for time since she is paid per audit. Her job is to sift through documentation and compare it with a checklist of requirements. If the documentation correlated cleanly with her checklist, her job would be much easier. How well organised and easy documents are to find influences her impression of the documents and the final audit results.
