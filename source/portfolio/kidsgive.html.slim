  section#research
    h2 Lack of understanding weakens confidence and enjoyment
    .text-flow-columns
      p In-depth interviews with children, parents, teachers and KidsGive staff gave us insight into the emotional rollercoaster of creating a crowdfunded charity campaign.
      p Creating a successful campaign isn't easy and success is key to developing a child's confidence. Understanding the whole process and the roles of various stakeholders is vital to a fun and stress-free campaign.

  section#personas
    h2 Seven stakeholders with different needs
    .text-flow-columns
      p We identified seven stakeholders: the child, parent, KidsGive administrator, beneficiary charity, donor and teacher. As well as their different needs and pain points, the different relationships between each stakeholder created some challenges. For example, parents had different needs of staff (understanding of administration fees, etc) compared to children.

    h2 Roller coasters should be fun!
    .text-flow-columns
      p A user journey clarified many of our research findings and communicated them clearly to the clients. It became apparent that organising a campaign can be an emotional roller coaster. Making key decisions about the campaign and holding events were identified as stressful.

    h2 Empowering kids: close connections to tangible achievements
    .text-flow-columns
      p Strategies to improve children's soft skills and values (known as <strong>in-reach</strong>) revolved around <strong>tangible</strong> achievements and building <strong>relationships</strong>.
      p Strategies to increase campaigns that met their targets revolved around <strong>campaign guidance</strong> and <strong>transparency</strong> for organisers and donors.

    h2 Initial sketches and feedback
    .text-flow-columns
      p Mock ups were shown to actual campaign organisers and other people with a range of tech savviness. We discovered there still was not enough information about how KidsGive worked, but also had to make all that information available at glance.

  section#iteration
    h2 The dashboard they'd been looking for
    .text-flow-columns
      p By incorporating listening to users' needs and their feedback from earlier prototypes, we gave them the features they needed without overwhelming them on the devices that they most commonly used.
      p We delivered on our brief by providing a number of tools, including a visualisations of the personal development of the child quantitatively and qualitatively in a dashboard. We made sure that campaigns were easy to navigate for the administrator with a searchable and sortable side nav.
      p The clients were so impressed with our presentation that we were asked to present again to the full board.
