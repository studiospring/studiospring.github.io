  Design has embraced lean and agile workflows and best practice has evolved. Innovation is becoming more important and these practices, adopted from the start up world, are becoming indispensible. Yet models like the double diamond, which the design process have not kept up. How can we better describe the process of design and innovation which designers follow today, so that team members and decision makers can understand it and make it a whole-of-organisation process?

Why the design process needs to be understood by management -> innovation is more important than ever. It is no longer a design process, it is an innovation process that the whole company needs to adopt.

If you are a designer, you have probably heard of the [double diamond](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080821115409/designcouncil.org.uk/en/about-design/managingdesign/the-study-of-the-design-process/) design process model. Sadly, if you are not a designer, you probably haven't heard of it. It was created by the British Design Council in 2005 and is still taught in design schools today. Since then, the process of design has changed, most notably with the adoption of lean practices and start up mentality. Newer design process models have appeared, but I do not think they illustrate current best practice. Here's my attempt at fixing that.

First, a little history about design process models. The earliest model that I am aware of is the [Universal Traveler's](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/592952.Universal_Traveler) ["Traveler's Map"](https://www.brainpickings.org/2011/11/11/the-universal-traveler-koberg-bagnall/). This was developed in the '70's and is remarkably similar to the models that have developed since, suggesting that there is a fundamental approach to problem solving. Compared to current thinking, it is a little light on user-centredness, focusing more on the creative process.

Next came the double diamond. What is nice about this model is that it reveals the broadening and narrowing of scope along the way. The **discovery** phase is one of casting a broad research net to understand the problem, then distill that in to a clearly **defined** problem. **Development** also expands in scope as you let go of constraints and ideate, only to narrow down and refine the solutions that you ultimately **deliver**.

The other well known model is the Stanford D.school [design thinking model](http://dschool.stanford.edu/redesigningtheater/the-design-thinking-process/). This model is also linear and follows a similar process, but is somewhat simplistic. It has since been [updated](https://dschool.stanford.edu/groups/k12/wiki/17cff/Steps_in_a_Design_Thinking_Process.html) to be more cyclical, at the expense of simplicity.

Most recently, there have been a number of lean/agile [models](http://lithespeed.com/lean-ux-dont-part-1-3-2/) which try to show how design fits in. Because agile was developed by programmers, most models are very dev focused and lack a design thinking or user focus. The other notable difference is that they are emphatically cyclical unlike previous models. Yet, to my knowledge, there is no authoritative model that designers turn to in order to explain how design fits within an iterative and flexible workflow.
 
In (a cheeky) homage to the double diamond, I have named this process "The Double Doughnut". It can be divided in to two parts: "problem identification" and "solution development" and 6 steps.

**Exploration** is constructing a research method and gathering information to understand the problem.

**Analysis** is the process of turning information into knowledge to gain a thorough (but shallow) understanding of the problem-scape.

**Insight** is the deep understanding of a problem by distilling it into root causes and interrelationships of various parts of the problem-scape. You want to be asking the [5 whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys) throughout the entire problem identification stage, but it is particularly important here.

**Ideation** is the unconstrained generation of the seeds of ideas, to be weeded later. 

**Synthesis** is the convergence of problem, idea and constraints to form a practical solution and reject lesser ones.

**Evaluation** is the assessment of a solution's effectiveness by testing with users for the purpose of refining a design. Testing can mean testing a prototype or measuring the effectiveness of a shipped product. Implicit in this step is the understanding that design is never finished and can always be improved.

Initially, I thought I could call this a design process, but on reflection, it is more than that. It actually is an innovation process. Design is no longer a silo that can be practised within just the design team. For a business to innovate (i.e. meet the needs of the customer in a better way not done before), the process of innovation needs to be understood and supported by all stakeholders in the organisation. 

Furthermore, ultimately a business cannot rely on established design patterns; it needs to create them. This is a key difference between design and innovation.

This process is no longer just a means of solving "the right problem and solving the problem right". By placing an equal emphasis on the research phase as the design phase, it is also about innovating as quickly and as far as possible. 

Then, you can see the complementary nature of the parts (exploration-ideation, analysis-synthesis, insight-testing) and the iterative nature of the process. 

It is also worth noting that in practice, each 'side' - problem identification and solution development - is often repeated before progressing to the other 'side'. So, a couple of research cycles may be needed before an appropriate research method is developed or the problem is understood well enough to start solving with designs.

**Exploration-ideation**: exploration and ideation are the initial understandings of the problem and solutions respectively. Because you are bootstrapping your understanding of a problem, exploration requires the creativity to imagine scenarios and hypothesise about areas that are worthy of study. Likewise, ideation requires an exploratory mindset in which you probe, question and discover the unimagined.

**Analysis-synthesis**: both are intermediate steps involving information or ideas that produce patterns or designs which are greater than the sum of their parts.

**Insight-testing**: both are a true understanding of the problem and solution respectively. Only by understanding the root of a problem do you truly understand it. Only by seeing a solution through the eyes of the user do you truly understand its effectiveness.

Though I have broken this process into discrete steps, in fact, it is a seamless process with ill-defined boundaries.
