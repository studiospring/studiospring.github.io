  The most recent design process model was developed in 2009??? Since then, the design process has changed to incorporate lean practices. How can we better describe the process of design that we follow today?

While studying UX design, I learnt about a number of design process models that helped me understand better what I was doing and how everything fit together. But I was also taught lean and agile workflows and none of these design models really gelled with these newer practices. So I developed my own model that better reflects current practices.

I suspect that the design process models that most designers are familiar with are the double diamond and D.school models. Most designers can see similarities between them and their own workflows. These days though, most experience designers work in the digital space, so, lean and/or agile practices that didn't exist in the days of the double diamond have also been adopted.

The [double diamond](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080821115409/designcouncil.org.uk/en/about-design/managingdesign/the-study-of-the-design-process/), created by the British Design Council in 2005 and the Stanford D.school [design thinking model](http://dschool.stanford.edu/redesigningtheater/the-design-thinking-process/) developed later, were both created before Eric Ries' Lean Start Up was published in 2008. And if you want to go back even earlier, there is the [Universal Traveler's](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/592952.Universal_Traveler) "Traveler's Map", from the 70's. None of these models really reflect the uncertainty and unfinished nature of design in our current world, for whatever reason.

There are a number of models describing lean/agile processes, but these look at the overall business or development process, not the design process. In my diagram, I have tried to illustrate the lean and agile paradigms that have infused the design process.

Like the double diamond, my updated design process, which I like to call a Lean Design Loop has two parts: research and ideation, or as I call them 'problem identification' and 'solution'. Each part is pretty self-explanatory, so feel free to skip the next section.

**Exploration** is constructing a research method and gathering information to bootstrap your knowledge of the problem.

**Analysis** is the process of turning information into knowledge to gain a thorough (but shallow) understanding of the problem-scape.

**Insight** is the deep understanding of a problem by distilling it into root causes and interrelationships of various parts of the problem-scape.

**Ideation** is the unconstrained generation of the seeds of ideas, to be weeded later. 

**Synthesis** is the convergence of problem, idea and constraints to form a practical solution and reject lesser ones.

**Testing** is the assessment of a solution's effectiveness by trialling with users for the purpose of refining a design.

Unfortunately, to best appreciate my new model, you need to see it in 3D, as a Moebius loop. Then, you can see the complementary nature of the parts (exploration-ideation, analysis-synthesis, insight-testing) and the iterative nature of the process. It is also worth noting that in practice, each 'side' - problem identification and solution - is often repeated before progressing to the other 'side'. So, a couple of research cycles may be needed before the problem is understood well enough to start solving with designs.

**Exploration-ideation**: exploration and ideation are the initial understandings of the problem and solutions respectively.

**Analysis-synthesis**: both are intermediate steps involving information or ideas that produce patterns or designs which are greater than the sum of their parts.

**Insight-testing**: both are a true understanding of the problem and solution respectively. Only by understanding the root of a problem do you truly understand it. Only by seeing a solution through the eyes of the user do you truly understand its effectiveness.

Though I have broken this process into discrete steps, in fact, it is a seamless process with ill-defined boundaries, nicely illustrated by the seamless nature of the Moebius strip.
