Understanding the whole process and the roles of various stakeholders is vital to the coordination of a fun and stress-free campaign.</p></div><figure><div class=img-wrapper><figcaption>Figure 3: Unearthing insights from the research.</figcaption><img alt="Yours truly and Mathilda working on some insights at a desk." src="/images/kidsgive/research.jpg"/></div></figure></section><section id=personas><h2>Personas for the seven stakeholders</h2><div class=text-flow-columns><p>We identified seven stakeholders: the child, parent, KidsGive administrator, beneficiary charity, donor and teacher. As well as their different needs and pain points, the different relationships between each stakeholder created some challenges. For example, parents had different needs of staff (understanding of administration fees, etc) compared to children.</p></div><figure><div class=img-wrapper><figcaption>Figure 4: Persona of Olly, the campaign organiser.</figcaption><img alt="" src="/images/kidsgive/persona_olly.min.svg"/></div></figure></section><section id=service-blueprint><h2>A service blueprint identified pain points</h2><div class=text-flow-columns><p>A user journey clarified many of our research findings and communicated them clearly to the clients.

For example, we identified that personal connections between the organiser, charity and donor would give greater meaning and transparency to all participants, so we connected them through a messaging system.</p></div><figure><div class=img-wrapper><figcaption>Figure 6: Specific problems relating to developing a child's skills were addressed through online and offline solutions.</figcaption><img alt="" id=inreach-map src="/images/kidsgive/inreach_map.png"/></div></figure></section><section id=sketch><h2>Usability tests with initial prototypes</h2><div class=text-flow-columns><p>Mock ups were shown to actual campaign organisers and other people with a range of tech savviness.
