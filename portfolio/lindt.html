How can Lindt's chocolate cafés become a more attractive destination within Australia's booming café culture?</p><p>Lindt have a number of cafés in major cities across the globe, serving hot drinks, desserts and meals, as well as selling chocolates.</p><p>Mix 3 UXers, 2 weeks and a lot of chocolate and here's what you get.</p></div></section><section id="research"><h2>The cafés: Lindt cafés have an image problem</h2><div class="text-flow-columns"><p>Visiting cafés and competitors, observing and surveying customers and staff revealed that the café experience was fantastic, but it had a very traditional image and low awareness, hence a narrow target market.</p></div><figure><div class="img-wrapper"><figcaption>Figure 1: SWOT analysis of 3 Lindt cafés in Sydney</figcaption><img alt="Strengths include: " src="/images/lindt/swot.svg" /></div></figure></section><section id="personas"><h2>The office worker, the tourist, the social butterfly</h2><div class="text-flow-columns"><p>Clientele to Lindt cafés vary with location, with the majority being locals (John, the office worker) or passers by (Michelle, the tourist).

This allowed us to identify realistic and effective solutions. We discovered that many of these ideas involved promotion, but also improved the customer experience.</p></div><figure><div class="img-wrapper"><figcaption>Figure 4: Cost benefit analysis of ideas</figcaption><img alt="Ideas such as supermarket promotion, refer a friend, signage, global loyalty program, e-payment and chocolate art were considered low cost/high benefit solutions.

This would be more familiar and still allow one touch ordering, loyalty updates, notifications and friend referral, and require fewer interfaces. Payment would be handled by Apple or Google Pay.</p></div><figure><div class="img-wrapper"><figcaption>Figure 6: Final iteration.</figcaption><img alt="" src="/images/lindt/bot.png" /></div></figure></section><section id="outcomes"><h2>We may be on to something!</h2><div class="text-flow-columns"><p>Speaking with a store manager, we were told that Lindt had similar plans to launch a mobile app with a loyalty program!
